The Real-Time Stock Tracker is a React app that displays live stock prices with predictive insights. Key components include:

- Dashboard.js: The main interface integrating other components.
- StockChart.js: Shows real-time price data on a line chart.
- Prediction.js: Provides a basic price prediction based on recent data.
- StockApi.js: Fetches live stock prices from an API.

This modular structure keeps the app organized and makes future updates, like advanced predictions and enhanced chart features, easy to implement.
